* dev notes *

Todo:
- Add integration tests, given this module with this object and this list of commands,
this is what the outcome should be
- Do this with various odd paths including 'add to end of array' and nested collections

Notes:

- Add replaces when not a collection, we can't add things to typed objects
- Describe all behavior, so consumer can compare to the spec
